Data Visualization and Storytelling

Create interactive visualizations in Power BI that tell a compelling story about sales data.  
Dataset used: **Superstore.csv** (or similar sales dataset).

 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop** for data loading, modelling, and visualizations.
- Built-in Power BI visuals (line charts, bar charts, cards, slicers).
- Sync Slicer feature for cross-page filtering.
- Export to PDF for final report.

📝 What I Did

1. Data Loading
- Imported the `Superstore.csv` dataset into Power BI Desktop.
- Checked column names, data types, and ensured dates and numeric fields were correctly recognised.

2. Report Pages (Story Chapters)
I created three pages

1. **Page 1 – Overview of Sales Performance**
   - KPI Cards showing Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders.
   - A bar chart of Sales by Region.
   - A slicer for selecting **Country** (applies to all pages).

2. **Page 2 – Sales & Profit Trends Over Time**
   - Line chart of Sales over time.
   - Line chart of Profit over time.
   - Slicer (Country) synced from Page 1.

3. **Page 3 – Category & Region Insights**
   - Bar chart of Sales by Category.
   - Bar chart of Profit by Region.
   - Same Country slicer synced across pages.


3. Visual Storytelling Techniques
- Clear Titles & Text Boxes: Each page has a large title and a small explanatory text under charts to describe key takeaways.
- Consistent Colour Scheme: Kept colours simple to avoid clutter.
- Country Filter Slicer: Added one slicer and enabled **Sync Slicers** so that when a country is selected, all pages update automatically.
- Navigation Buttons: Inserted “Next” and “Back” page navigation buttons so the report can be browsed like slides.

4. Exporting / Sharing
- Exported the report to **PDF** (File → Export → PDF) to submit as a visual report.
- Saved the `.pbix` file as well.

📊 Key Insights Example
- Technology category generates the highest sales and profit in most countries.
- Year-on-year sales growth shows steady increase.
- Western region consistently outperforms other regions in profit.
- 
📁 Repository Contents
- `Task2_Report.pdf` – Exported PDF showing all pages in sequence.
- `README.md` – This file, explaining what was done.

🚀 Outcome
By completing this task, I:
- Learned to import and model data in Power BI.
- Built multiple pages with interactive visuals.
- Exported a professional-looking PDF report ready for presentation.
